**p6**

for the longest path, when the last node is reached, the algorithm must converge.



**p11**

a) the forwarding table at node x:

|      | x    | y    | z    | w    |      |
| :--- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| x    | 0    | 4    | 6    | 5    |      |
| y    | 4    | 0    | 2    | 1    |      |
| z    | 5    | 1    | 0    | 1    |      |
| w    | 6    | 2    | 1    | 0    |      |

b) 

yes, there's x-y-z loop more than 2 nodes.

in my assumption nodes soon know x-y is 60. In the solution at t0 z tells y that z-x is 6 but that path is z-w-y-x so it should be âˆž. Or does the node only identify the first node on its path? er, right, that's based on the forwarding table.

so for z, every 3 iterations brings 5+ for z-x, so when z-x is 50 it's the 27th iteration. then through this all values are finally clarified at 31st.

c)

y-x is infinity.
